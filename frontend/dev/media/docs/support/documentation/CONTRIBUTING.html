Since this project template is very specific to the author&#39;s methods, habits, preferences, programming style and the initial intended purpose was uniquely directed at the author&#39;s needs, <strong>contributions</strong> are <strong>not</strong> a good fit for this project.  However, that does not mean constructive suggestions on improvements would not be appreciated, they are always encouraged and welcome.</p>
<h4 id="cloning-forking-and-pull-requests">Cloning, Forking and Pull Requests</h4>
<p>With that being said, <code>cloning</code> this project, rather than <code>forking</code>, is the ideal method when using this project as a template for your own projects.  Hence, <code>pull requests</code> would probably never take place on this project.   </p>
