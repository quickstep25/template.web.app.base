#<i class="icon-fork"></i> Contributing
Since this project template is very specific to the author's methods, habits, preferences, programming style and the initial intended purpose was uniquely directed at the author's needs, **contributions** are **not** a good fit for this project.  However, that does not mean constructive suggestions on improvements would not be appreciated, they are always encouraged and welcome.

#### Cloning, Forking and Pull Requests
With that being said, `cloning` this project, rather than `forking`, is the ideal method when using this project as a template for your own projects.  Hence, `pull requests` would probably never take place on this project.
